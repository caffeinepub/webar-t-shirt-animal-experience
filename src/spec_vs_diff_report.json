  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements by adding a local MindAR library file (placeholder), updating index.html to load from local path, removing CDN-specific type declarations, and cleaning up App.tsx to remove network checks and CDN validation logic. However, the MindAR library file is only a placeholder with instructions rather than the actual library content.",

      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Download the MindAR library and bundle it locally - the actual library content must be present, not just a placeholder",
      "reason": "The file frontend/public/lib/mindar/mindar-image-three.prod.js contains only placeholder text with download instructions and a console.error, not the actual MindAR library code. The AC states 'window.MINDAR is successfully defined after local script loads' which will not be satisfied with this placeholder.",
